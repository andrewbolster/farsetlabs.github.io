# The Short Rules 

Any community needs a few rules to stay safe and fun, and we don't like making more than we have to. 

These can be summarised in two statements:

* Leave the space better than you found it.
* Treat others (and their stuff) as you expect you (and your stuff) to be treated.

If this is somehow not clear or you believe you have found a loophole, please read on.

## Slightly Longer Rules

While in Farset Labs, you, the members and visitors, are expected to comply to the following Code.

### Culture and Ethos

 * Be Excellent to each other;
 * Don't disturb those who do not want to be disturbed;
 * [Intolerance will not be tolerated](equality.html);
 * If you see something and it doesn't look right or safe, it probably isn't so ask/tell someone about it;
 * [Intolerance will not be tolerated](equality.html).

### Handling of Complaints and Breaches
 * Technical issues related to the space may be raised through our [Issue Tracker](http://jira.farsetlabs.org.uk)
 * All members should endeavour to resolve minor personal issues directly with the persons involved;
 * If this is not possible, the following general approach is to be applied (with exceptions for complaints towards office holders outlined in the [Ops Manual](ops_manual.html));
    * Raise a complaint to either the [Directors](mailto:admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) or [NEMs](mailto:nems@services.farsetlabs.org.uk) detailing the issue and the persons involved. Reports may be anonymously filed but this will slow the response, as the management board[^1] will first have to corroborate the claims raised.
    * The issue will be raised at the next Management meeting and, at that boards discretion, directly with the persons involved.
    * After at most one bi-weekly management meeting, a response will be issued by a member of the management board[^1] that may result in a warning or subsequent expulsion of those involved.

[^1]: The Management Board consists of both the Directors of Farset Labs and the Non-Executive Mangers (NEMs)
