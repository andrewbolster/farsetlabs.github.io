# Facilities & Resources

Farset Labs is a [makerspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) that
provides a place for creativity and technological tinkering. We're open to
everyone, no matter what you want to do, and we welcome people from all walks
of life to use our space, come to our events, get involved and foster the maker community in Northern Ireland.

For a low [membership fee](/membership/index.html), students, hobbyists, and all members of the local community will be able to come together, hack at projects, build stuff and bring some life to Belfast!

Farset Labs provides a wide range of communal resources, so you can play and build as you wish. These include:

  * Dedicated high-speed fibre internet.
  * Ample networking and server resources.
  * Kitchen and lounge.
  * A growing library of tools, manufacturing equipment, parts and gadgets, including: 3D printer, quadcopter, various robots, and computers of all sorts such as Raspberry Pis, iMacs, BBC Micros and a hefty archive of gaming consoles.

  * Electronics, communications and computer science.
  * Manufacturing, making & craft.
  * Light metalworking & woodworking.
  * Biohacking & chemistry.

We provide space, tools and community. Members can come as little or as often as they like, 24 hours a day, and can use as many of the resources as they please (within reason!). Farset doesn't ask for anything extra, and we don't take any stake in your wildly successful ideas. However, we ask members to adhere to a [Code of Conduct](/about/code_of_conduct.html) to avoid injury, upset... and fires.
